We went around and brought one current topic of design research every week. While most of the meetings were us just blabbering potty philosophy on random topics such as what user-centered design really is, why DYI makes sense, why not socialism and etc, the meetings really gave me the time and the opportunity to figure out and communicate what I think `good design` is. ↵↵_Now, as a 13 months old design researcher looking back, I pretty much still suck ass in research, but, ....
